🚀 **Say Hello to Saral Applications: Job Applications, Made Easy (and Fun!)** 🎉  

Ever found yourself endlessly typing the same details into job application forms and wondering if there's a better way? Me too! That’s why I built **Saral Applications**—a Python-React web app that makes filling out job forms a breeze.  

👉 **Why did I create this?**  
Sure, there are fantastic extensions out there like **Simplify**, **JobWizard**, and **JobFiller** (kudos to them 👏), but here’s the deal:  
- They don’t work on *every* site.  
- Sometimes they fill things… let’s say, *creatively*. 😅  

When these tools hit a wall, **Saral Applications** steps in to save the day. It’s like a trusty sidekick, not a replacement. Think of it as a **cherry on top** of your job-filling toolkit. 🍒  

⚠️ **Quick heads-up**:  
Saral Applications isn’t here to take over the world of auto-fill tools (yet). It’s a **complementary solution** for when extensions hit their limit.  

👉 **How does it work?**  
Here’s the magic in a nutshell:  
- **Prepped and Ready:** You upload a data file with all your job application details.  
- **Click-to-Fill:** Rather than filling everything automatically (and risk mistakes), you simply click a button to fill each field with precision.  
- **Python Wizardry:** Behind the scenes, the Python backend works its magic with the `pyautogui` library, typing your data where it’s needed.  

It’s like having your own personal assistant for job applications. 🖱️✨  

👉 **Why is it different?**  
✅ Doesn’t try to guess and autofill *everything*.  
✅ Lets you control what goes where with a single click.  
✅ Steps in when tools like **Simplify**, **JobWizard**, or **JobFiller** decide to call it a day.  

🎥 **What’s next?**  
I don’t know, you tell me! This is a subpart of a large project which I am currently working on. Creating a complete dashboard controller for Entertainment.
